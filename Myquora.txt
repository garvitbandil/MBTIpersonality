STOP PUTTING FICTIONAL MEN ON A PEDESTAL FOR DOING THE BARE MINIMUM.
Imagine hating cuties like lily aldrin and pam beesley halpert y'all need serious help.
There are daily so many comments about Jim and Pam. Pam gets so much hate. I never understood why? Same with Marshall and Lily from HIMYM. Why do the female counterparts of so called great men always get so much hate?
Sitcoms create the most perfect man ever by making them do what is NORMAL and the bare minimum and then blame their female partner for being flawed. Sitcom women get so much hate for no reason. I've seen this w/ Pam Beesley as well as Lily Aldrin.

When is Money Heist S5P2 coming???
Why do y'all behave like dating more than one person is a crime? Every relationship is not about privileges. Stop randomly hating on a woman because she had more than one partner. Mind your own business instead of spitting on the internet. https://t.co/af9rykpw5o

Hello guys
If there is one thing that will single-handedly ruin education for us it is this epidemic called MCQs or Multiple Choice Questions. It is not just a disease, but a damn epidemic. It alone holds more potential to ruin much more than what Covid could do in 2 years.
You know there's this thing you do with a movie, it's called releasing it. Ever heard of it? üòÄ https://t.co/JrSFF64H4s
This particular director is going to post random offscreen pics from shoot to pacify the fans but not release the movie not even a poster or trailer. They're fooling fans since 8 years now when they have nothing concrete to serve. So much for the most epic "magnum opus"
